#Math and Data for beginning reporting#

##Summary##

All communicators, regardless of interest, discipline or medium, need to understand numbers to do their jobs effectively. More and more of society is being transformed by data as our lives are increasingly stored in databases. If you can't understand data and the basic math that you'll use regularly on the job, you are at the mercy of people who can.

This module is designed to solve a particular problem: How do you get basic data journalism into a beginning reporting class that many feel is packed as it is? My answer is to combine the basic math for reporters with instructions on how to apply those concepts in a spreadsheet using real data, all aimed at generating real story ideas. This document will show: 

* Basic math concepts and how to calculate them by hand.
* How to apply those basic math concepts to a spreadsheet of data.
* How to turn basic math + a spreadsheet of data into a story idea.

Contained in this repository are the datasets used to illustrate the concepts. They are kept here in .csv format, so you can use Excel, OpenOffice or Google Spreadsheets to do the same analysis. The spreadsheet formulas and concepts will work on any of those three software platforms.

##Introduction##

#####Bad at math is a lie#####

Let me guess: There's a not-insignificant part of you that's pretty happy to be in journalism school because the math requirements are pretty minimal. Have you ever said, out loud, "I can't do math, I'm a journalism major!" Have you ever thought "It's okay, I'm bad at math." Have you been bad at math your whole life?

First, you're not alone.

Second, you're living a lie.

    More here later.

##The basics of the basics##

**If you don't know these, you are doomed from the start.**

#####Notation####

One of the most difficult hurdles for beginning students of mathematics to get over is notation. If you miss a day, tune out for a class, or just never get around to asking what something means, you'll be lost. So lets just cover some bases and make sure we all understand some ultra-basic notation. 

You might laugh at these, but someone reading them is looking up Gods on Wikipedia to thank. So do yourself a favor and refresh.


|Symbol|Meaning|Example| 
|------|-------|-------|
|+|addtion|5+2|
|-|subtraction|6-2|
|* |multiplication|7*2|
|/|division|8/2|
|^|exponent|2^3|
|sqrt|square root|sqrt(4)|

	Author notes: More? Delta? Sigma? Coming back to this.


#####Order of operations#####

One of the most important and often overlooked concepts in basic math is the order that you do the calculations. When you have something like `5+5*5^2`, which gets done first? Or, as you'll read in the next section, what comes first when you calculate the average of a thing? The adding up of all the numbers or the division by the number of numbers?

Thankfully, math teachers have provided us an easy to remember memonic that you probably learned in sixth grade and forgot until now. 

**PEMDAS** -- **P**arenthesis, **E**ponents, **M**ultiplication, **D**ivision, **A**ddition, **S**ubtraction

What that means is when you look at a mathematical formula, you do the calculations in the order PEMDAS tells you. Something in parenthesis? Do that first. Is there an expoennt? Do that next. Muliplication or division? It's next and so forth.  Knowing PEMDAS will save you from stupid mistakes down the road.
